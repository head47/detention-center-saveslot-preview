# Detention Center Saveslot Preview
Small mod for Invisible Inc. that shows the number of available detention centers on the saveslot preview.

The main use case is playing 1 player = 1 agent co-op (hotseat or by Incognita Socket) and knowing at a
glance which campaign can be joined by additional players.
